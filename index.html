  <section><h2>Photo by Kristel Hayes on Unsplash</h2>
The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
<br>The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
<br>The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
<br>And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
  </section>

Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
<br>And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
<br>Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
<br>And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;
 </section>

Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower<br>
The moping owl does to the moon complain<br>
Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bower,<br>
Molest her ancient solitary reign.
 </section>

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,<br>
Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,<br>
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,<br>
The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.</section>
  <section><h2>Photo by Adrian on Unsplash</h2>
The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,
<br>The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,<br>
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,<br>
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</section>
  <section><h2>Photo by Max Letek on Unsplash</h2>
For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,<br>
Or busy housewife ply her evening care:<br>
No children run to lisp their sire's return,<br>
Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.</section>

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,
<br>Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
<br>How jocund did they drive their team afield!
<br>How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!</section>
